For Testing:
1.)Build as given in official cups-filters repository
2.)Set poppler priority value to any value less than 99 if your enviroment has ghostscript 
3.)Find this line "POPPLER_LIBS = -L/usr/local/lib -lpoppler" in your MakeFile and replace it with "POPPLER_LIBS = -L/usr/local/lib -lpoppler -lpoppler-cpp"
4.)Build again and test as follows:
cupsfilter -i application/vnd.cups-pdf  -m application/vnd.cups-raster file > dump
5.)Then rasterview dump to view the file
6.) I have generated the results for some files and they are available [here](https://github.com/tanmayanand44/pdftoraster-gsoc19-test_reports)
